	% For the last decades, Machine Learning experienced an incredible boom in many different domains.
	% Nowadays it is quite hard to find applications that don't use Machine Learning for improving the general purpose.
	% ML is everywhere. In camera software of your smartphone, in smart cars or planes, in stock trading programs, social networks and so on. In many cases Machine Learning Models are trained on highly sensitive data like information the user of a social network provides. This data consisting of location, age, name, friends, work place, hobbies, parents and so on, is used to improve algorithms like predicting whether two people know each other or not. Since nowadays graphs - a datastructure consisting of nodes and edges - are a common way to store and visualize data, Machine Learning algorithms have been improved to directly operate on them. In our work, we show, that so called Graph Neural Networks can reveal sensitive information about their training data. We focused on extracting information about the edges of the underlaying graph by observing the predictions of the target model.

	Since nowadays graphs are a common way to store and visualize data, Machine Learning algorithms have been improved to directly operate on them.
	In most cases the graph itself can be deemed confidential, since the owner of the data often spends much time and resources collecting and preparing the data.
	In our work, we show, that so called Graph Neural Networks can reveal sensitive information about their training graph.
	We focused on extracting information about the edges of the underlaying graph by observing the predictions of the target model in so called link stealing attacks. \TODO{present results}

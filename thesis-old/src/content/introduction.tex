	\section{Motivation}
		% Nevertheless Machine Learning led to an incredible progress in nearly everything, it also brings new problems. Since Machine Learning models are often trained on sensitive data, the fact that they are very likely to leak information about their training data becomes even more critical. Also, Machine Learning models are capable of observing correlations in the data provided. That means, that a model trained on faces to define the gender, simulatniously learns information like race and age, which later on can be extracted by an attacker. \TODO{cite}
		A graph is a datastructure which is used to model large data and the relationships between entities.
		It consists of nodes and edges and can be used to model data in almost every domain.
		For example in social networks, healthcare analytics or protein-protein interactions.
		In a social network, the nodes would be the users that are registered and the edges would represent whether the users know each other or not by connecting them or not.
		A graph itself can be deemed as intellectual property of the data owner, since she may spent lots of time and resources collecting and preparing the data.
		In most cases the graph is also highly confidential because it contains sensitive information like private social relationships between users in a social network or medical information about specific people in healthcare-analytic datasets.

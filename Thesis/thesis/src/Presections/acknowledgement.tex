I would like to thank my advisor, Xinlei He and my supervisor, Dr. Yang Zhang for guiding me through this thesis.
I really appreciate the time spent for our meetings, friendly talks and messages and preparation talks.
Without them I couldn't say, that writing my thesis was the best task during my studies. 
I learned so much about machine learning in general and specifically GNNs, which wouldn't be possible without them.
I would also like to thank Dr. Cristian-Alexandru Staicu for being my second reviewer.
Thanks also to the CISPA department for letting me use their resources.
Without them this thesis would have taken much longer.
I would also want to thank all my friends, who reviewed the thesis for their awesome feedback.
Big thanks also to my family and friends who had to put up with me during my studies.
It's because of them, that I am now at this point in my life.

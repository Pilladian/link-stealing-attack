  abstract = {In object tracking problem, most methods assume brightness constancy or subspace constancy, which are violated in practice. In this paper, the object tracking problem is considered as a transductive learning problem and a robust tracking method is proposed under intrinsic and extrinsic varieties. The object not only fits the object model, but also has the same cluster with the previous objects, which are the labeled data. By constraining the global and local information, the cost function is constructed firstly. The solution for minimizing the cost function can be solved by a simple linear algebra with graph Laplacian. Moreover, a novel graph is constructed over the positive samples and candidate patches, which can simultaneously learn the object's global appearance model and the local intrinsic geometric structure of all the patches. Furthermore, a heuristic positive samples selection scheme is adopted to make the method more effective. The proposed method is tested on different videos, which undergo large pose, expression, illumination and partial occlusion, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results and comparative studies are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.}

abstract = {Graph-based transductive learning (GTL) is a powerful machine learning technique that is used when sufficient training data is not available. In particular, conventional GTL approaches first construct a fixed inter-subject relation graph that is based on similarities in voxel intensity values in the feature domain, which can then be used to propagate the known phenotype data (i.e., clinical scores and labels) from the training data to the testing data in the label domain. However, this type of graph is exclusively learned in the feature domain, and primarily due to outliers in the observed features, may not be optimal for label propagation in the label domain. To address this limitation, a progressive GTL (pGTL) method is proposed that gradually finds an intrinsic data representation that more accurately aligns imaging features with the phenotype data. In general, optimal feature-to-phenotype alignment is achieved using an iterative approach that: (1) refines inter-subject relationships observed in the feature domain by using the learned intrinsic data representation in the label domain, (2) updates the intrinsic data representation from the refined inter-subject relationships, and (3) verifies the intrinsic data representation on the training data to guarantee an optimal classification when applied to testing data. Additionally, the iterative approach is extended to multi-modal imaging data to further improve pGTL classification accuracy. Using Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease study data, the classification accuracy of the proposed pGTL method is compared to several state-of-the-art classification methods, and the results show pGTL can more accurately identify subjects, even at different progression stages, in these two study data sets.}

We state the conditions under which our algorithm is guaranteed to converge.

abstract = {Essentially all data mining algorithms assume that the data-generating process is independent of the data miner's activities. However, in many domains, including spam detection, intrusion detection, fraud detection, surveillance and counter-terrorism, this is far from the case: the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives. In these domains, the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed, as the adversary learns to defeat it. Currently the only solution to this is repeated, manual, ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier. In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem. We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary, and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary's optimal strategy. Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way, and (within the parameters of the problem) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary's evolving manipulations.},

Performing an in-depth case study on privacy in personalized warfarin dosing, we show that suggested models carry privacy risks, in particular because attackers can perform what we call &lt;i&gt;model inversion&lt;/i&gt;: an attacker, given the model and some demographic information about a patient, can predict the patient's genetic markers. As differential privacy (DP) is an oft-proposed solution for medical settings such as this, we evaluate its effectiveness for building private versions of pharmacogenetic models. We show that &lt;i&gt;DP mechanisms prevent our model inversion attacks when the privacy budget is carefully selected&lt;/i&gt;. We go on to analyze the impact on utility by performing simulated clinical trials with DP dosing models. We find that for privacy budgets effective at preventing attacks, &lt;i&gt;patients would be exposed to increased risk of stroke, bleeding events, and mortality&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt; DP mechanisms do not simultaneously improve genomic privacy while retaining desirable clinical efficacy, highlighting the need for new mechanisms that should be evaluated &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; using the general methodology introduced by our work.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNN) offer the powerful approach to node classification in complex networks across many domains including social media, E-commerce, and FinTech. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to attacks aimed at adversely impacting their node classification performance. Existing studies of adversarial attacks on GNN focus primarily on manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, a task that requires greater effort on the part of the attacker in real-world applications. In contrast, it is much more expedient on the part of the attacker to inject adversarial nodes, e.g., fake profiles with forged links, into existing graphs so as to reduce the performance of the GNN in classifying existing nodes. Hence, we consider a novel form of node injection poisoning attacks on graph data. We model the key steps of a node injection attack, e.g., establishing links between the injected adversarial nodes and other nodes, choosing the label of an injected node, etc. by a Markov Decision Process. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method for Node Injection Poisoning Attacks (NIPA), to sequentially modify the labels and links of the injected nodes, without changing the connectivity between existing nodes. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical Q-learning network to manipulate the labels of the adversarial nodes and their links with other nodes in the graph, and design an appropriate reward function to guide the reinforcement learning agent to reduce the node classification performance of GNN. The results of the experiments show that NIPA is consistently more effective than the baseline node injection attack methods for poisoning graph data on three benchmark datasets. },

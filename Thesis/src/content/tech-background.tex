	\justifying \noindent
	Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where so called Machine Learning Models try to improve their accuracy, based on given data, that was used for training earlier \cite{simeone2018brief}. In that way, Machine Learning (ML) Models try to predict future behavior given unseen data, while considering prior learned knowledge.

	This is done by first finding a mathematical / formal description of the problem. \cite{ProvaUserManual}

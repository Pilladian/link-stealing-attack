	% Machine Learning experienced incredible boom in last decades \par
	% Big Data leads to huge amount of data available for training ML models \par
	% Graph Neural Networks operate on Graphs that can represent huge amount of data \par
	% In most cases sensitive / private ( Social Networks, Medical Data ) \par 
	% Neural Networks have been extended by processing / learning on graphs \par

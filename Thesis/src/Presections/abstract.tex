  Since nowadays graphs are a common way to store and visualize data, Machine Learning algorithms have been improved to directly operate on them.
	In most cases the graph itself can be deemed confidential, since the owner of the data often spends much time and resources collecting and preparing the data.
	In our work, we show, that so called Graph Neural Networks can reveal sensitive information about their training graph.
	We focused on extracting information about the edges of the underlaying graph by observing the predictions of the target model in so called link stealing attacks. \TODO{present results}

# Link Stealing Attack - Experimental Setup and Results

## Target Model

#### Approach
Given a graph with a few labeled nodes the model performs label prediction on the unlabeled ones. For calculation of the feature / embedding vectors GraphSAGE is used. GraphSage calculates the embedding of node `i` based on their neighborhood.

#### Parameter
| Parameter     | Value     
|------         |------     
| Type          | GraphSAGE
| Epochs        | 200
| Hidden Layer  | 2         
| Hidden Nodes  | 16        
| Learning Rate | 0.01      
| Dropout       | 0.5

#### Results
| Dataset  | Avg. Accuracy     
|------    |------     
| Cora     | 0.79
| Citeseer | 0.64

## Attacker Model

#### Approach
Given a Graph Neural Network the model performs a link stealing attack based on the posteriors that are generated by the GNN.

#### Parameter
| Parameter     | Value     
|------         |------     
| Type          | FNN
| Epochs        | 200
| Hidden Layer  | 2         
| Hidden Nodes  | 16        
| Learning Rate | 0.01      
| Dropout       | 0.5

#### Dataset
The dataset currently depends on the dataset the target model used. It is generated in the following way:

```py
set = test_subset of the dataset used for training the target model

# check for neighbors
for node in set:
    # 50% label = True
    if random([True, False]):
        if has_at_least_one_neighbor:
            post_n = target_model(node)
            post_nn = target_model(one_neighbor_of_node)
            features += concat(post_n, post_nn)
            labels += True
        else:
            post_n = target_model(node)
            post_nn = target_model(node-1)
            features += concat(post_n, post_nn)
            labels += False
    # 50% label = False
    else:
        post_n = target_model(node)
        post_nn = target_model(no_neighbor_of_node)
        features += concat(post_n, post_nn)
        labels += False
```

#### Training
One feature vector, consisting of two posteriors are fed into the model. It then predicts whether the two nodes, the posteriors came from, are connected or not. The label is used for calculating the loss and update the network.

#### Results
| Parent Dataset  | Avg. Accuracy     
|------           |------     
| Cora            | 0.72
| Citeseer        | 0.70
| Pubmed          | 0.80

`Future Work: ` Train on a model that used Cora as dataset but evaluate on a model that used Citeseer as dataset.
